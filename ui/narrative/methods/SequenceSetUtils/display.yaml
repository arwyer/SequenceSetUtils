    <p>This is an application to support the motif discovery framework. Because downloading genomes is computationally costly, it is more efficient to extract the promoter sequences of interest once before performing motif discovery as opposed to extracting the sequences at runtime. Users should use the BuildFeatureSet application to create a list of features whose promoters will then be extracted in this application and uploaded into a SequenceSet object that can be used as input for motif discovery.</p>
